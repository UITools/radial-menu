# Interactive Web Documentaries

Interactive web documentaries are intended  to be viewed and experienced in a browser environment, typically involving some mix of interaction and audio-visual feedback. Interactive developers must handle a wide array of technological innovations and fallbacks to reach a wide audience. Additionally, there is no de-facto standard, book, blog, or framework on how to code or implement interactive media. Due to these facts, organizing and coding these types of projects is a blank canvas. Are you ready to start painting?
